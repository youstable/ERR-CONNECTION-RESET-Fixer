# ERR-CONNECTION-RESET-Fixer
This tool executes a sequenced diagnostic pipeline on Windows to pinpoint why Chrome/Edge shows ERR_CONNECTION_RESET. It validates connectivity end‑to‑end, flushes DNS safely, inspects system and WinHTTP proxies, reviews Wi‑Fi profiles and link health, detects MTU/fragmentation pitfalls, surfaces HOSTS anomalies, verifies time/TLS sanity etc.
